myminerals is a personal mineral collection program. It can be considered an alternative, or an addition to using physical labels. Having a digital collection allows quick organization based on the information entered. For instance, you can list all the minerals you have collected at a specific locale. Using this, you can sell/trade multiple minerals you have of the same type from the same locale, or use the information to collect minerals you don't have yet for a specific locale. Also, you can always retain records of minerals in your collection, even if they have been lost, destroyed, stolen, traded, or sold.

A digital collection can become more powerful with the more information you add to it. Adding images of specimens will allow you to easily display parts of your collection that are in storage, or specimens that you no longer possess. Adding information about a specimen like colors, transparency, size, rating, etc., can be useful in many ways. Knowing how many minerals you have of a particular size can help when trying to figure out the best way to package them. You could search for your favorite pieces of a particular color to put on display.
